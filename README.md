## üìñ From Big Vision to V1

OnlyPans started as a ‚Äúgo big or go home‚Äù idea: a social cooking platform with premium subscriptions, live cooking, AI meal planning, DMs between chefs, a marketplace for ingredients, and native mobile apps. The ERD was ambitious by design‚Äîthink Recipes, Ingredients, Steps, Tags, Ratings, Comments, Messages, Subscriptions, Orders and more all talking to each other.

Then reality stepped in (in a helpful way). To ship something reliable and genuinely useful, I focused on a crisp V1 that nails the core experience: creating, discovering, and discussing great recipes. That meant deferring a few dream features for now, keeping the stack lean, and polishing the flows users touch the most.

Here‚Äôs the spirit of the scope reduction:

-   Time-boxed delivery over feature sprawl
-   Keep the data model clean and extensible
-   Optimize performance and UX for the essentials
-   Deploy with confidence (Heroku + Postgres) and iterate

What was in the original ERD vs what shipped in V1:

-   Subscriptions, DMs, live sessions, and marketplace ‚Üí Deferred to roadmap
-   AI recommendations ‚Üí Designed as a future layer on top of tags and search
-   Mobile apps ‚Üí Prioritized fully responsive web with Bootstrap 5
-   Video streaming ‚Üí Kept to images + rich content for now

Bottom line: All the foundations are here to grow‚Äîthe UX is tight, the data model is solid, and the app is delightful to use today.

## üó∫Ô∏è ERD at a Glance

The project uses a practical, production-ready slice of the original ERD. Core entities you‚Äôll see throughout the app:

-   User & UserProfile: accounts, preferences, dietary flags
-   Recipe: title, description, times, servings, images
-   Ingredient & RecipeIngredient: flexible amounts, units, notes
-   Step (RecipeStep): ordered instruction steps with optional images
-   Tagging: Cuisine and Dietary tags for discovery and filtering
-   Rating: 1‚Äì5 star system with averages
-   Comment: threaded comments with replies

## üß™ Testing & What to Screenshot

V1 includes a solid testing setup focused on the real user flows‚Äîcreating recipes, searching, viewing details, commenting, and rating.

Run tests locally:

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# With coverage (optional)
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
coverage html
```

What the tests cover:

-   Models: Recipes, ingredients, tags, ratings, comments
-   Views: Auth, CRUD, permissions, list/detail flows
-   Forms: Recipe form, search, validation rules
-   Integration: End-to-end happy paths with key edge cases

Great testing screenshots to include:

-   Terminal output of a passing test run (e.g., 100+ tests, all green)
-   Coverage summary (coverage report) and a screenshot of the HTML coverage index
-   Any failing test‚Äôs clear error message (if demonstrating TDD or debugging)

Tip: save screenshots under planning/images or a docs/screenshots folder.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Constraints & Technical Decisions

Why some things waited for later‚Äîand why that‚Äôs a strength:

-   Simplicity > complexity: shipped with a clean, maintainable data model
-   Heroku + Postgres: reliable deployment path that‚Äôs easy to scale
-   Bootstrap 5 + custom CSS: polished, responsive UI without a heavy SPA
-   Cloudinary: effortless, reliable image handling
-   Modal-based auth: faster UX, fewer page loads

Deferred (by design): subscriptions/payments, DMs, live video, AI recs, marketplace, and native apps. The current architecture makes these add-ons straightforward when the time is right.

## üå± Roadmap

-   Smart recommendations (start with ‚Äúsimilar by tags‚Äù ‚Üí evolve to ML)
-   Saved collections and meal planning
-   Public profiles and follow system
-   Premium content tiers and payments
-   API endpoints for future mobile apps
-   Rich media (short clips) with CDN-backed hosting

## üß† AI Implementation (What‚Äôs in, what‚Äôs next)

-   In this iteration, AI helped with storyboarding user flows, generating realistic seed recipes, and accelerating debugging.
-   The search/tag model is ready for ML-driven recommendations (e.g., collaborative filtering or embeddings).
-   Next steps: smart search suggestions, personalized feeds, and auto-tagging ingredients from images via a lightweight model.
